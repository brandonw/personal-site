<h1 class="text-center heading">BRANDON WASKIEWICZ</h1>

<p>I am a software developer with interests varying
from new programming language development and theory, to game development,
to web development. I love languages with great type systems (current favorites
being <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>), as well as languages whose
open source communities contribute prodigious amounts of awesome code (like
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>). I also play with C every once
in a while to keep me honest, and use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>
when I am working on Windows-centric software.</p>

<p>My GitHub account can be found
<a href="https://github.com/brandonw/">here</a>. I can be reached via e-mail at
<a href="mailto:brandon.waskiewicz@gmail.com">brandon.waskiewicz@gmail.com</a>.

<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>I grew up with an interest in experimenting with
computers. I have fond memories of connecting to Bulletin Board Systems as a
kid, using up my daily playtime on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon">L.O.R.D.</a>,
and then starting up QBasic and trying to create my own version-- ASCII
graphics start screen and all.</p>

<p>That eventually led to me trying to learn C++
by reading Borland's Turbo C++ manual during lunch periods in middle school
(even though it was admittedly over my head at the time), and culminating in
my choice of Computer Science major at the
<a href="http://www.umass.edu/">Univeristy of Massachusetts at Amherst</a>.</p>
